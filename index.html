# Approaching a Legacy System

by Emmanuel Delgado

???
My name is Emmanuel Delgado, I am a Software Developer and I currently work for modcloth.com.
---


# Agenda

1. Set a context
2. Adopt a few core ideas
3. Initial approach
4. Look for documentation

???
This is how the general talk is gonna go, it will take around 20 mins, with a mix of ideas, stories,
and tools/code.
---


# 1. Set a context

--

## Wikipedia definition
> In computing, a legacy system is an **old** method, **technology**, **computer system**, or **application program**, "of, relating to, or being a previous or **outdated computer system**." Often a pejorative term, referencing a system as "legacy" means that it paved the way for the standards that would follow it. This can also imply that the system is out of date or **in need of replacement.**

--
- Old
- Technology
- Computer System
- Application Program
- Outdated computer system
- In need of replacement

???
- What is a Legacy System?
---

# 2. Adopt a few core ideas

- Curiosity
--

- Assess risk
--

- Fear and courage
--

- Ensure safety harnesses
--

- Ask questions
--

- Experiment
--

- Take notes

???
- Curiosity need to be your driven force
- You can not move without assessing Risk first
- Don't move without safety harnesses
- Ask questions to yourself, and everyone who may know about the system
- Fear is ok
---

# 3. Initial approach
Just look at the files:
```bash
$ ls
Capfile              README.md            config.ru            public
Gemfile              Rakefile             db                   script
Gemfile.lock         Vagrantfile          doc                  spec
Guardfile            app                  features             spec.acceptance
Procfile             certs                lib                  vendor
Procfile.development config               log
```

```bash
$ ls app
assets      helpers     middleware  presenters  stylesheets
controllers jobs        models      services    views
```
---

Look deeper:
```bash
$ tree app lib

504 directories, 3052 files

Looks like rails and ruby so, how much ruby?:
```bash
$ ag -l 'class|module' --ruby | wc
  3227    3227  157092
```
--

How much ruby in *lib* and *app*?:
```bash
$ ag -l 'class|module' --ruby  app lib |wc
  1836    1836   79395
```
--

How many files types are there [thank you stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1842254/how-can-i-find-all-of-the-distinct-file-extensions-in-a-folder-hierarchy)?
```bash
$ find . -type f \
  | sed -e 's/.*\.//' \
  | sed -e 's/.*\///' \
  | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn| wc
     217     434    3881
```
---

Top counts:
```bash
$ find . -type f \
  | sed -e 's/.*\.//' \
  | sed -e 's/.*\///' \
  |head -n10
3579 rb

# What have we learned so far?
- Rails
- 3K~ ruby files
- 1K~ frontend related files

# 4. Become a Git historian
```bash
$ brew upgrade git-extras
Error: git-extras 4.3.0 already installed
$ git summary
git summary |more

 project  : e-comm
 repo age : 9 years
 active   : 2420 days
 commits  : 42828
 files    : 9942
 authors  :
  1806  Person 1  4.2%
  1566  Person 2  3.7%
  1431  Person 3  3.3%
  1218  Person 4  2.8%
  1072  Person 5  2.5%
   962  Person 6  2.2%
   878  Person 7  2.1%
   729  Person 8  1.7%
   717  Person 9  1.7%
   711  Person 10 1.7%
   674  Person 11 1.6%
```
---

Aggregating the results a little bit:
```bash
git summary \
  | ag -o '[a-zA-Z\s]+' \
  | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' \
  | ag -o '\w+(\s\w+)?' \
  | sort | uniq| wc
     325     522    3715
```

- You can also go to github in case it is stored in github
- Or use the cool https://github.com/IonicaBizau/git-stats

# What have we learned so far?
- Rails
- 3K~ ruby files
- 1K~ frontend related files
- 9 years
- ~9K git tracked files
- ~300 different devs
---

# 4. Look for documentation
We learned about how big the code base is, as we look for documentation this are somethings
that you may want to understand:
- Is there any documentation at all?
- Is there good commentary on the code?
- Does the names of things make sense?
- Are the system use cases are documented?
- Is someone in the team that understand the system?
---

Seems that we have a *doc* folder:
```bash
$ git whatchanged doc
commit d2968ae8573095ed32676f11dbc3a97d77d0549d
Author: Person X
Date:   Wed Jun 11 12:58:30 2014 -0400

    [SB] Delete random file?

:100644 000000 ab1b12981e... 0000000000... D    doc/obsolete/BCREC.csv
```

Last document modified on 2014, so it's time to start your documentation.
--

- Document every finding, clean up later
- Keep documentation close to the code, simple is better.

---
Here are a few things to keep in mind:

- You must understand the design/architecture.
- Most of the times you don't come back and refactor.
- Be careful about redesigning without refactor.

???
- One common problem for systems that have been alive for a few years and sometimes even younger systems is that every new developer.
- New designs on top of the existing ones without refactoring, then they get bored or leave and now we have new designs on top of the older ones.
