# Approaching a Legacy System

by Emmanuel Delgado

???
My name is Emmanuel Delgado, I am a Software Developer and I work for modcloth.com.
---

# Agenda

1. Definition and mindset
2. Just look at the files
3. Become a Git historian
4. Look for documentation
5. Understand your boundaries
6. The daily boy scout
7. Static analysis tools
8. Understand your tests
9. Extract features
10. Adopt a few core ideas

???
This is how the general talk is gonna go, it will take around 20 mins, with a mix of ideas, stories,
and tools/code.
---


# 1. Definition and mindset

## Wikipedia definition
> In computing, a legacy system is an **old** method, **technology**, **computer system**, or **application program**, "of, relating to, or being a previous or **outdated computer system**." Often a pejorative term, referencing a system as "legacy" means that it paved the way for the standards that would follow it. This can also imply that the system is out of date or **in need of replacement.**

  # 1. Definition and mindset
]

## Get ready for an archeology trip
- Start writing down notes of everything you are learning
- It does not have to be a book, keywords may be enough
- Mind maps are great

.center.mindmap[![](dev-plan.jpg)]
---

# 2. Just look at the files
- Use **ls** to look for clues on what the domain knowledge looks like:

```bash
$ ls
Capfile              README.md            config.ru            public
Gemfile              Rakefile             db                   script
Gemfile.lock         Vagrantfile          doc                  spec
Guardfile            app                  features             spec.acceptance
Procfile             certs                lib                  vendor
Procfile.development config               log
```

```bash
$ ls app
assets      helpers     middleware  presenters  stylesheets
controllers jobs        models      services    views
```
---

.grayed-out[
  # 2. Just look at the files
]
- Use **tree** to look deeper:

```bash
$ tree app lib
lib
├── activate_toggle_switch.rb
├── active_merchant
│   └── billing
│       ├── braintree_mod_gateway.rb
│       └── gateways
│           └── modcloth_bogus.rb
├── active_record_selective_error_presenter.rb
├── active_shipping
│   ├── active_shipping
│   │   ├── lib
│   │   │   ├── country.rb
│   │   │   ├── error.rb
...
└── wsdl
    ├── ShipServiceDevelopment_v9.wsdl

504 directories, 3052 files
```
---

.grayed-out[
  # 2. Just look at the files
]
- Use **ag**, **wc**. It looks like rails and ruby so, how much ruby?:
  ```bash
  $ ag -l 'class|module' --ruby | wc
    3227    3227  157092
  ```

- How much ruby in *lib* and *app*?:
  ```bash
  $ ag -l 'class|module' --ruby  app lib |wc
    1836    1836   79395
  ```

- How many files types are there [thank you stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1842254/how-can-i-find-all-of-the-distinct-file-extensions-in-a-folder-hierarchy)?
  ```bash
  $ find . -type f \
    | sed -e 's/.*\.//' \
    | sed -e 's/.*\///' \
    | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn| wc
       217     434    3881
  ```
---

.grayed-out[
  # 2. Just look at the files
]
- Use **find**, **sort**, **sed**, **uniq**, **head** to get the top counts per file type:
  ```bash
  $ find . -type f \
    | sed -e 's/.*\.//' \
    | sed -e 's/.*\///' \
    | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
    | head -n10
  3579 rb
  1634 png
   829 js
   775 erb
   586 gif

   511 haml
   372 scss
   248 gem
   124 css
    81 feature
    77 rake
    58 csv
    52 yml
    41 html
    39 htm
    38 xml
    17 svg
  ```
---

# 3. Become a Git historian
- Use **git-extras** to get a summary of the project
  ```bash
  $ brew upgrade git-extras
  Error: git-extras 4.3.0 already installed
  $ git summary
  git summary |more

   project  : e-comm
   repo age : 9 years
   active   : 2420 days
   commits  : 42828
   files    : 9942

    1566  Person 2  3.7%
    1431  Person 3  3.3%
    1218  Person 4  2.8%
    1072  Person 5  2.5%
     962  Person 6  2.2%
     878  Person 7  2.1%
     729  Person 8  1.7%
     717  Person 9  1.7%
     711  Person 10 1.7%
     674  Person 11 1.6%
  ```
---

.grayed-out[
  # 3. Become a Git historian

* Aggregate results with **ag**, **tr**, **sort**, **uniq** and **wc**
  ```bash
  git summary \
    | ag -o '[a-zA-Z\s]+' \
    | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' \
    | ag -o '\w+(\s\w+)?' \
    | sort | uniq| wc
       325     522    3715
  ```
- You can also go to github in case it is stored in github
- Or use the cool https://github.com/IonicaBizau/git-stats

# 4. Look for documentation
As we look for documentation keep in mind:

- Is there any documentation at all?
- Is there good commentary on the code?
- Does the names of things make sense?
- Are the system use cases are documented?
- Is there someone in the team that understand the system?
---

.grayed-out[
  # 4. Look for documentation
]
- Seems that we have a *doc* folder:
  ```bash
  $ git whatchanged doc

  ```

- The last document modified on 2014, so it's time to start your documentation.
---


.grayed-out[
  # 4. Look for documentation
]
## Here are a few things to keep in mind:

- Document everything you learn.
- Keep documentation close to the code, simple is better.
- You must understand the design/architecture.
- Once you understand something refine it's documentation.

???
- One common problem for systems that have been alive for a few years and sometimes even younger systems is that every new developer.
- New designs on top of the existing ones without refactoring, then they get bored or leave and now we have new designs on top of the older ones.
---

# 5. Understand your boundaries
One way to help you understand the architecture is to understand the boundaries. Let's
start with your *Gemfile*:
```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

ruby '2.0.0'

gem 'rails', '~>3.2.17'

gem 'active_presenter'
gem 'activemerchant', '~>1.42'
gem 'ancestry', '>=1.2.4'
gem 'acts-as-taggable-on', '~> 3.4.2'
gem 'ambethia-smtp-tls', '1.1.2', :require => 'smtp-tls'
gem 'american_date'
gem 'aws-sdk'
gem 'bitly'
gem 'braintree', '2.32.1'
gem 'yajl-ruby'
gem 'chronic'
gem 'curb'
gem 'haml-rails'
gem 'haml-contrib' # we need this for the Textile filter, that was moved out of core HAML
gem 'simple_form' #, github: 'plataformatec/simple_form', branch: 'v2.2' # admin dependency
...
```
---

.grayed-out[
  # 5. Understand your boundaries
]

- A naive filter would give me a better idea:
  ```bash
  $ ag -o "\'[\w-]+\'" Gemfile \
    | tr "'" " " \
    | sort \
    | wc
       188     188    2675
  ```

  .left-column[
    ```bash
    $ ag -o "\'[\w-]+\'" Gemfile \
      | tr "'" " " \
      | sort
     activemerchant
     activerecord-import
     activerecord-nulldb-adapter
     acts-as-taggable-on
     acts_as_list
     addressable
     airbrake
     ambethia-smtp-tls
     american_date
     ancestry
     ap
     awesome_nested_set
     awesome_print
    ```
   ]

  .right-colum[
    ```bash
     capistrano
     capistrano-ext
     capybara
     capybara-screenshot
     capybara-webkit

     codeclimate-test-reporter
     colorize
     compass

     connection_pool
     cookie_slasher

     curb
     ...
     typhoeus
     validates_timeliness
    ```

.grayed-out[
  # 5. Understand your boundaries

- Remember your notes
- Draw how the boundaries look like
- You don't need to follow a specific methodology, just draw

# 6. The daily boy scout
I heard it from [Uncle Bob](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/The_Boy_Scout_Rule):

> Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it.

- Excuses are many, get over them
- Now let's figure out where to start
---


# 7. Static analysis tools
There is [metric_fu](https://github.com/metricfu/metric_fu), but let's take a look to only a few of its tools, plus my favorite [rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) and as a bonus [unused](https://github.com/joshuaclayton/unused).

- churn

# 8. Understand your tests
Try the following:
- Squint test your files
- Identity the [Subjet Under Test (SUT)](http://xunitpatterns.com/SUT.html)
- Understand the test setup and dependencies

And:
- Find out the test coverage
- Single Responsibility Principle also applies to tests

Further reading:
- There are [Test Smells](http://xunitpatterns.com/Test%20Smells.html)

# 9. Extract features
> Often times changing code will get just hard, consider extracting features into a new app

When:
- Lack of documentation or outdated
- Single test containing multiple SUT
- Low coverage
- Hard test setups
- Slow test suite

How:
- Create a high level collaborative test suite, check [Specification by Example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_by_example)
- Bring enough code to make tests pass, iterate
---

# 10. Adopt a few core ideas
- Curiosity
- Assess risk
- Fear and courage
- Ensure safety harnesses
- Ask questions
- Experiment
- Take notes
- The boy scout rule

???
- Curiosity need to be your driven force
- You can not move without assessing Risk first
- Don't move without safety harnesses
- Ask questions to yourself, and everyone who may know about the system
- Fear is ok
