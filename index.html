# Approaching a Legacy System

by Emmanuel Delgado

???
My name is Emmanuel Delgado, I am a Software Developer and I currently work for modcloth.com.

# Agenda

0. Set a context
0. Adopt a few core ideas
0. Just look at your files
0. Become a Git historian
0. Look for documentation
0. Understand your dependencies
0. Get some metrics
0. Understand your tests
0. Consider extracting features

???
This is how the general talk is gonna go, it will take around 20 mins, with a mix of ideas, stories,
and tools/code.
---


# 1. Set a context

--

## Wikipedia definition
> In computing, a legacy system is an **old** method, **technology**, **computer system**, or **application program**, "of, relating to, or being a previous or **outdated computer system**." Often a pejorative term, referencing a system as "legacy" means that it paved the way for the standards that would follow it. This can also imply that the system is out of date or **in need of replacement.**

--
- Old
- Technology
- Computer System
- Application Program
- Outdated computer system
- In need of replacement

???
- What is a Legacy System?
---

# 2. Adopt a few core ideas

- Curiosity
--

- Assess risk
--

- Fear and courage
--

- Ensure safety harnesses
--

- Ask questions
--

- Experiment
--

- Take notes

???
- Curiosity need to be your driven force
- You can not move without assessing Risk first
- Don't move without safety harnesses
- Ask questions to yourself, and everyone who may know about the system
- Fear is ok
---

# 3. Initial approach
Just look at the files:
```bash
$ ls
Capfile              README.md            config.ru            public
Gemfile              Rakefile             db                   script
Gemfile.lock         Vagrantfile          doc                  spec
Guardfile            app                  features             spec.acceptance
Procfile             certs                lib                  vendor
Procfile.development config               log
```

```bash
$ ls app
assets      helpers     middleware  presenters  stylesheets
controllers jobs        models      services    views
```
---

Look deeper:
```bash
$ tree app lib

504 directories, 3052 files
```

Looks like rails and ruby so, how much ruby?:
```bash
$ ag -l 'class|module' --ruby | wc
  3227    3227  157092
```
--

How much ruby in *lib* and *app*?:
```bash
$ ag -l 'class|module' --ruby  app lib |wc
  1836    1836   79395
```
--

How many files types are there [thank you stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1842254/how-can-i-find-all-of-the-distinct-file-extensions-in-a-folder-hierarchy)?
```bash
$ find . -type f \
  | sed -e 's/.*\.//' \
  | sed -e 's/.*\///' \
  | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn| wc
     217     434    3881
```
---

Top counts:
```bash
$ find . -type f \
  | sed -e 's/.*\.//' \
  | sed -e 's/.*\///' \
  |head -n10
3579 rb

# What have we learned so far?
- Rails
- 3K~ ruby files
- 1K~ frontend related files
---

# 4. Become a Git historian
```bash
$ brew upgrade git-extras
Error: git-extras 4.3.0 already installed
$ git summary
git summary |more

 project  : e-comm
 repo age : 9 years
 active   : 2420 days
 commits  : 42828
 files    : 9942
 authors  :
  1806  Person 1  4.2%
  1566  Person 2  3.7%
  1431  Person 3  3.3%
  1218  Person 4  2.8%
  1072  Person 5  2.5%
   962  Person 6  2.2%
   878  Person 7  2.1%
   729  Person 8  1.7%
   717  Person 9  1.7%
   711  Person 10 1.7%
   674  Person 11 1.6%
```
---

Aggregating the results a little bit:
```bash
git summary \
  | ag -o '[a-zA-Z\s]+' \
  | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' \
  | ag -o '\w+(\s\w+)?' \
  | sort | uniq| wc
     325     522    3715
```

- You can also go to github in case it is stored in github
- Or use the cool https://github.com/IonicaBizau/git-stats

# What have we learned so far?
- Rails
- 3K~ ruby files
- 1K~ frontend related files
- 9 years
- ~9K git tracked files
- ~300 different devs
---

# 4. Look for documentation
We learned about how big the code base is, as we look for documentation this are somethings
that you may want to understand:
- Is there any documentation at all?
- Is there good commentary on the code?
- Does the names of things make sense?
- Are the system use cases are documented?
- Is someone in the team that understand the system?
---

Seems that we have a *doc* folder:
```bash
$ git whatchanged doc
commit d2968ae8573095ed32676f11dbc3a97d77d0549d
Author: Person X
Date:   Wed Jun 11 12:58:30 2014 -0400

    [SB] Delete random file?

:100644 000000 ab1b12981e... 0000000000... D    doc/obsolete/BCREC.csv
```

Last document modified on 2014, so it's time to start your documentation.
--

- Document every finding, clean up later
- Keep documentation close to the code, simple is better.

---
Here are a few things to keep in mind:

- You must understand the design/architecture.
- Most of the times you don't come back and refactor.
- Be careful about redesigning without refactor.

???
- One common problem for systems that have been alive for a few years and sometimes even younger systems is that every new developer.
- New designs on top of the existing ones without refactoring, then they get bored or leave and now we have new designs on top of the older ones.
---

# 5. Understand your dependencies
One way to help you understand the architecture is to understand the dependencies. Let's
start with your *Gemfile*:
```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

ruby '2.0.0'

gem 'rails', '~>3.2.17'

gem 'active_presenter'
gem 'activemerchant', '~>1.42'
gem 'ancestry', '>=1.2.4'
gem 'acts-as-taggable-on', '~> 3.4.2'
gem 'ambethia-smtp-tls', '1.1.2', :require => 'smtp-tls'
gem 'american_date'
gem 'aws-sdk'
gem 'bitly'
gem 'braintree', '2.32.1'
gem 'yajl-ruby'
gem 'chronic'
gem 'curb'
gem 'haml-rails'
gem 'haml-contrib' # we need this for the Textile filter, that was moved out of core HAML
gem 'simple_form' #, github: 'plataformatec/simple_form', branch: 'v2.2' # admin dependency
...
```
---
A naive filter would give me a better idea:
```bash
$ ag -o "\'[\w-]+\'" Gemfile \
  | tr "'" " " \
  | sort \
  | wc
     188     188    2675
```
.left-column[
  ```bash
  $ ag -o "\'[\w-]+\'" Gemfile \
    | tr "'" " " \
    | sort
   activemerchant
   activerecord-import
   activerecord-nulldb-adapter
   acts-as-taggable-on
   acts_as_list
   addressable
   airbrake
   ambethia-smtp-tls
   american_date
   ancestry
   ap
   awesome_nested_set
   awesome_print
   aws-sdk
   bartt-ssl_requirement
   better_errors
   bitly
   braintree
   builder
  ```
 ]

.right-colum[
  ```bash
   capistrano
   capistrano-ext
   capybara
   capybara-screenshot
   capybara-webkit
   chronic
   codeclimate-test-reporter
   colorize
   compass
   compass-rails
   connection_pool
   cookie_slasher
   cucumber-rails
   curb
   ...
   typhoeus
   validates_timeliness
   vcr
   will_paginate
   yajl-ruby
   zendesk_remote_auth
   zip-code-info
  ```
]

---
- This is also a good opportunity to get familiar with new libraries that potentially
you will have to learn.
- You could also look for the *require* statements:
  ```bash
  $ ag 'require' --ruby --ignore-dir app/views app lib
  ```
- This is too manual, try [rubrowser](http://www.blazeboy.me/rubrowser/)

???
- Pending what do you understand from rubrowser?
